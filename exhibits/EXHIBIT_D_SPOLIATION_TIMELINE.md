# EXHIBIT D: Evidence Destruction Timeline (Spoliation)

**Case:** Francesco Longo v. Crown et al.  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Classification:** CRITICAL EVIDENCE

---

## Summary

All evidence in Case ID 94545 was destroyed within **14 days** of dismissal, despite a mandatory **2.5-year minimum** retention period. This constitutes criminal spoliation.

---

## The Unanswerable Question

> "Your Honour, the case was dismissed. Mischief over $5,000. The Crown stated in open court it was 'no longer worthy of pursuing.'
>
> **Why was ALL evidence destroyed within 14 days?**
>
> Why were 79 files added 8 days AFTER dismissal? What were the 13 photographs? What is so important about a dismissed mischief case that it required destruction in record time—faster than legally possible under retention schedules?"

## Spoliation Analysis

### Standard Retention Requirements

| Jurisdiction | Minimum Retention | Source |
|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Ontario | 2 years | Police Services Act |
| Federal | 2.5 years | RCMP Policy |
| Best Practice | 7 years | Law Society Guidelines |

### Actual Timeline

- **Required minimum**: 2.5 years (912 days)
- **Actual retention**: 14 days
- **Deviation**: 898 days short (98.5% faster than required)

---

## The 13 Photographs

Disclosure documents reference **13 photographs** that were:
- Listed in MCMS (case management system)
- **Never disclosed** to the accused
- **Destroyed** with all other evidence

**Question**: What did those photographs show?

---

## The 79 Post-Dismissal Files

**79 files were added to the case 8 days AFTER dismissal.**

- Case was closed September 15, 2025
- Files added September 23, 2025
- All destroyed September 29, 2025

**Question**: Why add files to a closed case, then immediately destroy everything?

---

## Legal Framework

### SS&C Technologies, 2024 ONCA 675, para. 45

> "When evidence is intentionally destroyed, the court MUST draw an adverse inference against the spoliating party."

### Application

The Crown/Police cannot now claim:
- The evidence was exculpatory (they destroyed it)
- The evidence was irrelevant (then why destroy it so fast?)
- Standard procedure was followed (14 days vs 2.5 years)

**The adverse inference**: The destroyed evidence was incriminating to the spoliating parties.

## Respondents' Impossible Dilemma

| Defense | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| "Standard procedure" | 14 days vs 2.5-year minimum — impossible |
| "Evidence was unimportant" | Then why destroy it? Why add 79 files post-dismissal? |
| "No bad intent" | Same day as Bellaire's retirement — consciousness of guilt |
| Silence | Treated as admission under spoliation doctrine |

**No matter which path: They lose.**

## Applicable Law

- **R. v. La, [1997] 2 SCR 680**: Duty to preserve evidence
