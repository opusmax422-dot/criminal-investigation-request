# Florida Surveillance Grid Analysis

**Analysis Period:** February 15-18, 2026  
**Primary Geographic Focus:** Florida "Triple-Node" Corridor  
**Data Sources:** Google Analytics, Canarytokens, Public WHOIS Records

## Executive Summary

Network traffic analysis reveals a coordinated surveillance pattern centered on a Florida logistics corridor spanning Hialeah shipping facilities, Fort Lauderdale corporate infrastructure, and Pembroke Pines administrative hubs. Traffic patterns demonstrate **reactive monitoring** - external IPs accessing evidence documentation within hours of documented Google search activities for related geographic locations.

## The Florida Triple-Node Corridor

### Geographic Overview

The surveillance grid consists of three interconnected nodes along the I-75/SR-826 corridor in South Florida:

```
Node A: Hialeah Shipping Yard (16114 NW 117th Ave, Hialeah, FL 33018)
   ↓ (~2.5 miles)
Node B: Hialeah Shipping Docks (14949 NW 117th Ave, Hialeah, FL 33018)
   ↓ (~10 miles north via I-75)
Node C: Pembroke Pines Administrative Hub (20800 Johnson St, Pembroke Pines, FL 33029)
```

**Total Corridor Distance:** ~15 miles  
**Transit Time:** 20-30 minutes via Interstate 75

- Surveillance infrastructure spans international boundary

## Investigative Questions

1. **MNSI Network Access:**  
   What is the operational justification for Zekelman-owned ISP infrastructure (MNSI) accessing evidence documentation from Tecumseh, ON?

2. **Reactive Florida Traffic:**  
   Why did Hialeah-based IP addresses access Canary tokens within hours of Google searches for Hialeah shipping facilities?

3. **Pembroke Pines Deep Engagement:**  
   What accounts for a single Pembroke Pines user conducting 30+ minutes of systematic document review (264 events) within 24 hours of Hialeah searches?

4. **Corporate-Surveillance Integration:**  
   How do Zekelman Industries logistics interests (steel distribution via I-75) intersect with documented surveillance patterns along the same corridor?

5. **Federal Coordination:**  
   Does the proximity of DEA/FBI/JTTF facilities to the triple-node corridor indicate integrated federal-local law enforcement monitoring?

6. **Cross-Border Operations:**  
   What is the relationship between Canadian corporate infrastructure (MNSI/Zekelman/Bellaire) and Florida logistics/surveillance nodes?
