# DEA-FBI Task Force Coordination Analysis

**Documentation Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Focus:** Inter-agency coordination structure connecting DEA Agent Glenn Dutton and FBI JTTF Supervisor William Lintz  
**Context:** 21-year investigation timeline (2005-2026)

## Executive Summary

This analysis documents the hierarchical and operational relationships between DEA field operations (Glenn Dutton) and FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force strategic oversight (William Lintz), examining how their coordinated roles intersect with documented investigation timeline events, corporate infrastructure (MNSI/Zekelman), and cross-border surveillance patterns (Windsor-Florida corridor).

**Key Finding:** The supervisory relationship between Lintz (FBI JTTF strategic planning) and Dutton (DEA tactical field operations) creates an integrated command structure for cross-border, multi-jurisdictional investigations that spans from initial 2005 events through 2026 surveillance patterns.
