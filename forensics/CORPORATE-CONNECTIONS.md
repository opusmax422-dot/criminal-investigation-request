- Interpretation: "wndson17" = Windsor node 17, cache server 04, version 2
- Significance: Corporate ISP infrastructure, not individual user
- Implication: Network-level access (DNS resolution required for token trigger)

**Florida IP Pattern:**
- IP: 87.101.93.230 (Hialeah geolocation)
- Timing: 01:24 UTC Feb 17 (within 3 hours of related Google searches)
- Correlation: Reactive surveillance (search → network response)

## Investigative Questions

1. **MNSI Network Access:**  
   What business or operational justification exists for MNSI corporate DNS infrastructure (owned by Clayton Zekelman) to access evidence documentation?

2. **Bellaire Role Transition:**  
   What is the relationship between Jason Bellaire's 21-year role in documented investigation (2005-2025 as Windsor Police Chief) and his current position as Head of Security for the owner of the ISP that accessed evidence?

3. **Cross-Border Coordination:**  
   How do DEA/FBI task force operations (Dutton/Lintz) coordinate with private corporate security (Bellaire/Zekelman) across US-Canada border?

4. **Florida Corporate Corridor:**  
   What is the relationship between Zekelman steel distribution interests, KEMET surveillance technology proximity, and federal law enforcement hubs along the same I-75 corridor?

5. **Reactive Surveillance Pattern:**  
   Why do both Canadian corporate infrastructure (MNSI) and Florida geographic IPs (Hialeah) access evidence within hours of documented search activities for related locations?

6. **Personnel Overlap:**  
   What protocols govern interaction between federal task force agents (Dutton/Lintz) and former local police chiefs now in private corporate security (Bellaire)?
